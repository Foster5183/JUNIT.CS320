# JUNIT.CS320
Coursework for SNHU CS320 
To ensure functionality and security in software under development, there is a multi-faceted employment consisting of a combination of testing, validation, and security best practices. Unit tests using JUnit are written to validate the logic of individual methods, while integration tests ensure that components work together as intended. Continuous testing works to catch errors early. For security, input validation and sanitization are incorporated to prevent injection attacks, enforce role-based access controls, and follow secure coding practices. There are other tools used, like static code analyzers to detect vulnerabilities while ensuring that data handling follows industry standards for encryption and privacy.
Interpreting user needs begins with gathering requirements through user stories, feedback, and use case analysis. User needs are broken down into specific functional requirements and proper prioritization. During design, wireframes, flowcharts, and user interface (UI) mockups are used to visualize how users will interact with the system. This process ensures the software’s features align with user expectations. By focusing on the user's perspective, software can be designed to be intuitive, efficient, and useful.
Software design is approached using an organized and methodical process. First, define the problem and gather user and system requirements. From there, create a high-level system architecture to define the relationships between components. There also exists the use of design principles such as modularity, abstraction, and separation of concerns to structure the software. Tools like UML diagrams, flowcharts, and ER diagrams help visualize the relationships between components, data flow, and logic. 
These projects showcase an ability to develop software with a focus on quality assurance, unit testing, and secure development practices. By including files like Contact.java, ContactService.java, and their associated test files, there exists a demonstration of an ability to write clean, maintainable code and apply testing strategies that work to ensure the development  of quality artifacts. The reflection component highlights the approach taken to software development, from requirement gathering and design to testing and security. This portfolio not only represents adept technical skills but also showcases experiential growth as a developer prepared to meet industry standards – or the lack thereof-.
